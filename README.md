# StockBot

The aim is to develop a bot that can communicate with you via SMS, Slack or some other mechanism. It can pull market data in real time and I plan on hooking it up with Alpaca to be able to trade on command. 

Goals:
1. Provide statistics on certain trades/positions
2. Pull lots of data and run advanced statistics 
3. Implement a DB to store relevant data
4. Create a texting/messaging feature to interact with you
5. Parse sites for earnings data / SEC data
